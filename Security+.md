# Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities
* Malware
  - Every malware will have a "propagation mechanism" and a "payload".
# Propagation Mechanism
The way that a malware object spreads
# Payload
The malicious action that the malware performs

* Any malware object can carry any payload.
* 3 malware types *
  1. viruses: spread by human action -> user education
  2. worms: spread by themselves -> update the system the most recent
  3. Trojans: disguise themselves as beneficial programs -> application controls
 
* RAT: Remote Access Trojans. Provide backdoors to hacked systems.

* 4 Payload types *
  1. Adware: Displays advertisements for the malware author
     - changing the default search engine
     - displaying pop-up advertisements
     - replacing legitimate ads with other ads
  2. Spyware: Gathers information
     - Logging keystrokes
     - Monitoring web browsing
     - Searching hard drives and cloud storage
  * PUPs: Potentially unwanted programs are slipped onto a system by other software installers
  3. Ransomware: Blocks access until you pay
  4. Cryptomalware: Steals compute capacity and Mines cryptocurrency
# These are independent programs written by malware developers
# But some are pieces of code inserted into other apps
1. Backdoors: Provide workaround access 
2. Logic Bombs: Deliver a triggered payload
   
* Preventing Malware *
  - Antimalware software
  - Security patches
  - User education

* Advanced malware
  1. Rootkits: Escalate user privileges
  2. Fileless Viruses: Remain in memory

* Botnets: collections of infected machines
  - IRC is a common command and control mechanism 

* Fileless viruses often store themselves to maintain persistence in 
* Malicious script execution
* A script is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language to automate our work
  - Shell Scripts
    * Bash is a shell scripting language that is used on Linux and Mac
    * PowerShell for windows
  
  - Application Scripts
    * Visual Basic for Applications - the most common macro
    * Macros
  - Programming Languages
    * Python
