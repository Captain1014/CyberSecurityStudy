# Offensive Security
## Web Application Security
* A database is used to store information
- The web application will read the data about the products and their details from a database server.
- A database server is responsible for many functions.
- Suppose an attacker manages to exploit the web app and steal the user's databse.

* You need a browser to access a web app

* Main categories of common attacks against web app
- Log in
- Search for the product
- Provide payment details

* Identification and Authentication Failure
- The audentication step is prone to different types of weaknesses.
- Allowing the attacker to use brute force
- Allowing the user to choose a weak password
- Storing the users' passwords in plain text

* Broken Access Control
- Access control ensures that each user can only access files related to their role or work.

* Injection
- An injection attack refers to a vulnerability in the web app where the user can insert malicious code as part of their input.
- the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the user's input.

* Cryptographic Failures
- Encryption ensures that no one can read the data without knowing the secret key.
- Decryption converts a ciphertext back into the original cleartext using the secret key.
- Sending sensitive data in clear text / using http instead of https
- relying on a weak cryptographic algo.
- using default or weak keys for cryptographic functions.
