# Networking basics
Decision tree for network problems
1. Did IP tools fix the problem?
2. No. escalate to the appropriate team
 corporate networking team
 home networking team
 wired or wireless?

IP tools
open powershell windows terminal
ipconfig - to know user's ip address
make them read the IPv4 address
does it match with subnet mask?
255.255.255.0
three times, then the first three octets should match

ping 8.8.8.8
if it's too slow ms, wireless network problem

ping google.com
test DNS system

cls

ipconfig /alã…£
DNS servers

tracert google.com
little stars
